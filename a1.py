MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
"I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience with Java and a little bit of html/bootstrap. Can you create 7 practice problems that cover:
> - How ariables and basic data types work
> - if/else/elif
> - for and while loops
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs."

üêç Python Practice Problems
1. Variables and Data Types: Favorite Number

Task:
Create a program that asks the user for their name and their favorite number. Print a sentence that combines both.

Example:

Input:
Name: Alice
Favorite number: 7

Output:
Hello Alice! Your favorite number is 7.

""" 
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("Name: ")
favorite_number = input("Favorite number: ")
print("Hello " + name + "! Your favorite number is " + favorite_number)

"""

2. Conditionals: Even or Odd

Task:
Write a program that asks the user for an integer and prints whether it‚Äôs even or odd.

Example:

Input: 12
Output: 12 is even.

Input: 9
Output: 9 is odd.

3. Loops: Counting Down

Task:
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer n and then prints a countdown from n to 1.

Example:

Input: 5
Output:
5
4
3
2
1

4. Functions: Temperature Converter

Task:
Write a function celsius_to_fahrenheit(c) that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns it in Fahrenheit.
Then ask the user for a Celsius value, call the function, and print the result.

Formula:

F = (C √ó 9/5) + 32


Example:

Input: 0
Output: 0¬∞C is 32.0¬∞F

5. Lists: Average of Numbers

Task:
Ask the user to enter 5 numbers (one at a time) and store them in a list.
Then calculate and print the average.

Example:

Input: 3, 5, 8, 10, 4
Output: The average is 6.0

6. Loops + Conditionals: Multiplication Table

Task:
Ask the user for a number n. Print its multiplication table from 1 to 10.
(Hint: use a for loop).

Example:

Input: 5
Output:
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50

7. Functions + Lists + Loops: Find the Largest Number

Task:
Write a function find_max(numbers) that takes a list of numbers and returns the largest one.
Ask the user to enter numbers separated by spaces, store them in a list, and call your function.

Example:

Input: 10 4 25 7 15
Output: The largest number is 25

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
print("Testing Problem 1:")
print(f"is_even(4): {is_even(4)}")  # Should print True
print(f"is_even(7): {is_even(7)}")  # Should print False
