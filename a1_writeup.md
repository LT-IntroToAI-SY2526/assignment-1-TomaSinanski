# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
It was pretty good. I took some getting used to as a long of things are simpler and require less syntax. Before this I had used Java, Processing JS, and HTML. Python has been most close to Java but the syntax in noticably simpler.
2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI when i wasn't fimiliar with syntax and the functionality of python. For example, I needed AI to explain how to create a for loop and I asked it for specific details and I got all the syntax I need along with how it works. It also gave me useful hints when I didn't know what logic to use when solving some of the harder questions.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
The most challenging for me was the syntax since Im very used to Java. AI helped me learn it initially but I got good just by practicing.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that it is most useful for hints instead of answers as then I'm forced to learn instead of just finishing the problem without retaining anything.
